Please look at the time stamp on the story to see when it was last updated.\n\nSAGINAW, Mich. \u2014 A man recently pardoned by former President Barack Obama was shot and killed by two men with assault-style rifles.\n\nIt happened at 9:40 p.m. on Jan. 23, at Bannum Place Federal Corrections Halfway House in Saginaw.\n\nMichigan State Police spokesperson Lt. David Kaiser told WNEM the two masked men barged into the building and shot 31-year-old Demarlon Thomas of Saginaw.\n\nHe was shot multiple times by one of the gunmen, while the other held roughly two dozen others at the home at gunpoint. Thomas died at the scene.\n\n\u201cOne person watched over a group of them while another subject located the victim and executed him,\u201d Kaiser told MLive.com. \u201cThey were looking for this person.\u201d\n\nThe two suspects then fled the area. No one else was injured.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t immediately known how long Thomas had been out of prison and living in the halfway house.\n\nThomas was a former Sunny Side Gang member, according to Kaiser. He was busted in one of the biggest drug busts in Saginaw, known as \u201cOperation Sunset.\u201d\n\nIn 2008, he was sentenced to 19 years in prison for the distribution of five grams or more of cocaine. The operation effectively ended the Sunny Side Gang.\n\nThomas was among the 79 people pardoned on Nov. 22 by former President Obama.\n\nHis jail sentence was set to expire in March.\n\nIf you have any information, call D/SGT. Jim Bush at (231) 250-9471 or Crime Stoppers at 1-800-422-JAIL.", "images":
