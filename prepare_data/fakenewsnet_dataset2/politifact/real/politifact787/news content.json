The only difference between Sen. Clinton\u2019s health care plan and mine is that she thinks the problem for people without health care is that nobody has mandated \u2014 forced \u2014 them to get health care.\u201d\n\nBefore jumping into this fray, it\u2019s important to note that when it comes to health care, the two Democratic presidential candidates have a lot in common.\n\nOne of the few differences is that Clinton includes a universal mandate. That means that after everything else goes according to plan, individuals will be required by law to purchase insurance. Think of how people are required to buy auto insurance and you get an idea of what that might look like.\n\nObama\u2019s plan includes a mandate to insure children, but it does not include a mandate for adults, as the Clinton and Edwards plans do. That likely means not as many people will be insured, said Kenneth Thorpe, professor of health policy and management at Emory University.\n\nObama\u2019s decision not to include a mandate is a more cautious approach, one Obama says is designed not to penalize people with modest incomes. If premiums don\u2019t drop enough after all the reforms are implemented, people will still be unable to afford insurance. If a law mandates they buy it anyway, they probably won\u2019t. Obama\u2019s argument is that if you then fine them, you\u2019re essentially punishing the poor \u2014 and they will still be uninsured. Obama is betting that his plan will get costs low enough that many of the estimated 47-million uninsured will sign up without a mandate, and a mandate will come later.\n\nSo is it fair for Obama to call his plan \u201cuniversal\u201d? Well, not really. Even if you buy his argument that his plan will create the market conditions to make health care universally available, nothing in his plan guarantees it. We rate his claim Barely True.", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20071205191621im_/http://politifact.com/media/img/artheds_browse.gif", "https://web.archive.org/web/20071205191621im_/http://politifact.com/media/img/artheds_the-statement.gif", "https://web.archive.org/web/20071205191621im_/http://politifact.com/media/img/logopf_aboutbox.gif", "https://web.archive.org/web/20071205191621im_/http://politifact.com/media/img/navbar-images-attack.gif", "https://web.archive.org/web/20071205191621im_/http://politifact.com/media/img/spacer.gif", "https://web.archive.org/web/20071205191621im_/http://politifact.com/media/img/navbar-images-home.gif", "https://web.archive.org/web/20071205191621im_/http://sptmain.122.2o7.net/b/ss/sptmain/1/H.1--NS/0", "https://web.archive.org/web/20071205191621im_/http://politifact.com/media/img/favicon.ico", "https://web.archive.org/web/20071205191621im_/http://politifact.com/media/img/tom-barelytrue.gif", "https://web.archive.org/web/20071205191621im_/http://politifact.com/media/img/navbar-images-issues.gif", "https://web.archive.org/web/20071205191621im_/http://politifact.com/media/img/navbar-images-cqcom.gif", "https://web.archive.org/web/20071205191621im_/http://politifact.com/media/img/navbar-images-candidates.gif", "https://web.archive.org/web/20071205191621im_/http://politifact.com/media/img/artheds_about-this-statemen.gif", "https://web.archive.org/web/20071205191621im_/http://politifact.com/media/img/navbar-images-tom.gif", "https://web.archive.org/web/20071205191621im_/http://politifact.com/media/img/artheds_about.gif", "https://web.archive.org/web/20071205191621im_/http://politifact.com/media/img/artheds_contribute.gif", "https://web.archive.org/web/20071205191621im_/http://politifact.com/media/img/artheds_search.gif", "https://web.archive.org/web/20071205191621im_/http://politifact.com/media/img/logoset_aboutbox.gif", "https://web.archive.org/web/20071205191621im_/http://politifact.com/media/img/truthinpolitics-3.gif", "https://web.archive.org/web/20071205191621im_/http://politifact.com/media/img/mug-btn-obama.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20071205191621im_/http://politifact.com/media/img/navbar-images-tbcom.gif", "https://web.archive.org/web/20071205191621im_/http://politifact.com/media/img/artheds_candidates.gif", "https://web.archive.org/web/20071205191621im_/http://politifact.com/media/img/navbar-images-rulings.gif", "https://web.archive.org/web/20071205191621im_/http://politifact.com/media/img/navbar-images-stories.gif", "https://web.archive.org/web/20071205191621im_/http://politifact.com/media/img/artheds_subscribe.gif"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20071205191621im_/http://politifact.com/media/img/favicon.ico", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "", "title": "He says universal, but it's no guarantee", "meta_data": {"description": "PolitiFact.com is a project of the St. Petersburg Times and Congressional Quarterly to help you find the truth in the presidential campaign", "keywords": "politics, presidential election, president, 2008 campaign, campaign 08, Democrats, Joe Biden, Hillary Clinton, Chris Dodd, John Edwards, Mike Gravel, Dennis Kucinich, Barack Obama, Bill Richardson, Republicans, Sam Brownback, Rudy Giuliani, Mike Huckabee, Duncan Hunter, John McCain, Ron Paul, Mitt Romney, Tom Tancredo, Fred Thompson, Obama Girl, video, TV, television, report, true, barely true, half true, mostly true, false, pants-on-fire, pants on fire, truth, truth-o-meter, facts, statements, research, analyze, speeches"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://web.archive.org", "summary": ""}
